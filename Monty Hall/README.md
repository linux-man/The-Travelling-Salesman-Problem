# Monty Hall Problem

Best solution: switch doors

## The problem

[Monty Hall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem) is an interesting paradox, just because the solution is so unintuitive.

In fact, I guess some people still don't accept the answer, even after this problem has been discussed ad nauseam.

For those who don't believe, now you can run a Scilab script that show what happens if a player "always keep the door" and "always switch the door".

Bottom line, we should stay alert. We must pay attention to changes. If there are changes, it's best for us to change.

Enjoy!
