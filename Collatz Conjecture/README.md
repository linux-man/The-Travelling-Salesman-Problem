# Collatz Conjecture

## The problem

This is one of many unsolved (or unproved) problems in Mathematics.

One of the charms of [Collatz Conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture) is it's simplicity. After all, you only need do add, multiply and divide to explore the function. A primary school student can do the math, but the result is... weird.

It's just one of those things. We may think that strangeness in mathematics is related to infinities, or remains hidden in transcendent numbers like Ï€ or *e*, but chaos is everywhere, even in the set of integers. Think about prime numbers.

Here you can find some Scilab scripts to help exploring this conjecture, and test really big integers.

It was so fun to think about Collatz conjecture that I even wrote a small [article](https://github.com/linux-man/The-Travelling-Salesman-Problem/blob/main/Collatz%20Conjecture/article.pdf).
